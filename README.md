# Introduction
In this project, I leveraged PySpark and Databricks to build a complete data processing and analysis pipeline. The primary objective was to showcase the capabilities of PySpark for handling large-scale data and the seamless integration of Databricks for data management, processing, and visualization.

# Project Objectives
1)Data Loading and Schema Definition: Load and define schemas for sales and menu datasets using PySpark's structured APIs.
2)Data Transformation: Engineer time-based columns such as year, month, and quarter to enable temporal insights.
3)Data Aggregation: Perform advanced aggregations to uncover key metrics like total spending by customer, product, and time periods.
4)Visualization: Utilize Databricks' built-in visualization tools to create meaningful charts and summaries for stakeholders.

# Datasets Used
1)Sales Data: Includes product_id, customer_id, order_date, location, and source_order.

2)Menu Data: Contains product_id, product_name, and price.

# Steps Taken
1. Schema Definition & Data Loading
Defined explicit schemas using StructType and StructField for both datasets.
Loaded CSV files into PySpark DataFrames for structured processing.

2. Data Transformation
Added new columns: order_year, order_month, and order_quarter using PySparkâ€™s built-in date functions.
Joined sales and menu datasets for comprehensive analysis.

3. Data Aggregation
1)Performed several analyses, including:
2)Total amount spent by each customer.
3)Product-wise sales breakdown across different time periods.
4)Most frequently ordered products.
5)Region-specific and order-source-specific trends.

4. Visualization
Used Databricks' display() function to generate interactive charts and tables.
Visualized data aggregated by location, source_order, and product popularity.

#Results & Insights
1)Customer Spending Patterns: Identified top-spending customers and segmented them by order channels.
2)Product Popularity: Recognized top-performing products and their seasonal trends.
3)Time-based Trends: Analyzed monthly, quarterly, and yearly spending patterns.
4)Regional Insights: Detected geographic differences in customer behavior and order sources.

# How to Run
1)Clone the repository:
2)Import the notebook into your Databricks workspace.
3)Run each cell step-by-step to observe the full data transformation, aggregation, and visualization flow.
